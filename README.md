Why "Free V-Bucks Code Generators" Are a Scam
Epic Games Does Not Support Generators:

V-Bucks, Fortnite’s in-game currency, are created and managed by Epic Games. There are no tools or software that can generate legitimate free codes.
Security Risks:

Malware and Viruses: Many websites or apps offering V-Bucks generators are traps that install malware, steal personal data, or compromise your device.
Phishing Scams: These fake sites often ask for your Epic Games login or payment information, leading to account hacking or financial theft.
Fraudulent Activity Detection:

Epic Games actively monitors its ecosystem for fraud. Using illegitimate methods to obtain V-Bucks can lead to:
Permanent bans on your Fortnite account.
Loss of access to your skins, cosmetics, and progress.
Legal Implications:

Using hacked or stolen codes violates copyright laws and terms of service agreements. In some cases, this could lead to legal action.
What Happens if You Use a Fake Generator?
Account Bans: If Epic Games detects unauthorized activity, your account can be suspended or permanently banned.
Financial Loss: Many of these tools ask for payment or personal information, leading to stolen funds or identity theft.
Device Damage: Downloading generator software may infect your computer, tablet, or phone with harmful programs.

Check for sales on gift cards or discounted V-Bucks bundles during special Fortnite events or seasonal promotions.
Tips to Avoid Scams
Stick to Official Sources: Only purchase V-Bucks through the Epic Games Store, authorized platforms, or official retailers.
Avoid "Too Good to Be True" Offers: Any site or app promising "unlimited free V-Bucks" is fraudulent.
Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Secure your Epic Games account to protect it from unauthorized access.
